> Code syntax highlighter for Mecha.

I use [highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org "Highlight.js &ndash; Syntax highlighting for the web") version `8.4` to support this plugin. Syntax highlighter credit should be directed to <http://highlightjs.org>. I only take the credit for this syntax highlighter configurator.

### Usage

Although **highlight.js** has an automatic language detection feature, but I would still recommend you to add a language class for each `<code>` tag to minimize the plugin tasks during page loading.

You cannot use the native **Markdown** syntax for creating a code block with classes by indenting a block of text. To add a class on the code block, use the [fenced code blocks](http://mecha-cms.com/article/markdown-syntax#reference:markdown-extra-s-fenced-code-block-syntax "Markdown Extra&rsquo;s Fenced Code Block Syntax") syntax in **Markdown Extra**:

``` .markdown
~~~ .html
<p>paragraph <b>bold</b>
~~~
```

or&hellip;

~~~ .markdown
``` .html
<p>paragraph <b>bold</b>
```
~~~

But, it&rsquo;s just a choice. You can still use the indentation method to create a code block, and the automatic language detection feature of **highlight.js** will handle the language class placement in your code block.
